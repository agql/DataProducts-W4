# Descriptive Analysis of HR Data
The work included in this presentation is based on a Datased from Kaggle <https://www.kaggle.com> by Ludovic Benistant, released under  <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/> License.

The Dataset includes anonymised information on employees, including the following fields:
- Satisfaction Level,
- Last Evaluation
- Number of projects
- Average monthy hours
- Time spent in the company (years)
- Salary level (High, Medium, Low)

I have related Statisfaction Level and Worked hours to see if there's any relationship. Also, I added in color the salary levels. The results are interesting we can identify three groups. It seems there's no relation with salaries. 

It'd be nice to explore which of these groups remain at the company longer. This is retained for future work
